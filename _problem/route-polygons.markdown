#Route Polygons#

*WasteMate’s GIS backend tracks all of your routes as polygons which are then easily viewed and inspected to identify inefficiencies.*

By defining the shape of an ideal route, you give WasteMate the intel it needs to fill in the holes with new customers as they sign up, automatically making it more efficient (and profitable!).

We’re also able to display the density of your routes by highlighting the addresses that are serviced, those that don’t have any service, and those that are serviced by another route. This type of visualization makes it very straightforward to identify problem areas and monitor routing changes.
