#Information Kiosk#

*Everything about your company is documented via WasteMate’s “learning” configuration process. No one person is essential to explaining processes or scheduling services.*

Your company’s operations have to be taught to WasteMate. Once WasteMate knows all about your regions, services, fleet, labor, and inventory, everyone in your organization is empowered with the same capabilities.

Our clients often learn things about their operation through WasteMate’s setup process. It makes sure you agree with yourself.
