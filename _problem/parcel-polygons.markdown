#Parcel Polygons#

*WasteMate identifies which parcels have service and which ones don’t. The web interface makes it easy to identify the areas with the most potential for profit.*

WasteMate’s roots in GIS allow it to map out the density of your routes, neighborhood by neighborhood, to locate the gaps where you’re missing out on potential customers. While this ability boasts many benefits, it is extremely effective at identifying areas for your outside sales team to target.
