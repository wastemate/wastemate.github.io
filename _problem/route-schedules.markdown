#Route Schedules#

*WasteMate’s internal logic can tell you which routes cover any address in your service territory.*

Users need only to enter an address and they will instantly be presented with detailed information about which day of the week each service can be performed. Once services are chosen, a full schedule is displayed that includes the upcoming days of service.

Customers ordering online have experiences similar to those of your staff. Once their address and order are known by WasteMate, customers will see which days each service is performed and can choose their start date based on the route schedule.
