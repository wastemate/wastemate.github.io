# Database Architecture #

*All information is set using polygons. Everything within a specific region will be consistent.*

WasteMate is built on Microsoft SQL Server 2014 and takes advantage of its advanced geospatial dataset features. All of your data is concretely linked to ensure that the application can never omit any required information.

Polygons are backed by services and routes. The services are backed by items and operations. Routes are backed by materials, labor and equipment. Itâ€™s a puzzle without any missing pieces.
