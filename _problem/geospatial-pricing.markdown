#Geospatial Pricing#

*All of your prices are mapped, so all services for every address are matched with an exact dollar amount.*

WasteMate is built around the concept of regions. A region can be any size, but at the core they are just a description of a particular area that you service. Once defined geospatially, all of the services you offer to customers in that region are linked and priced. Upcoming price changes can be entered well ahead of time with an effective start date, so there are no late nights spent at the office preparing for an increase.

Every address located in a specific region will have pricing associated with it. Just type in the address to get the price. Itâ€™s that easy.
